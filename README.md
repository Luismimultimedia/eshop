# Eshop (Test Serempre)

This is a project developmented by Luis Miguel Gonz√°lez to make the technical test for the company Serempre, this project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.3.

**What was the hardest thing of this test?**
As Front end developers we use to work with layouts frameworks that really help a lot to make the components, but when you have to face a project using "hand-made" functionalities and layaouts it became hard, and it became harder when you have to be a "pixel perfect" and work with media querys to fix the responsive problems, also i you dont have a solid fundation of javascript. In this project i implemented Cloud Firestore as a service of backend to store and bring the detail product data of the project.
